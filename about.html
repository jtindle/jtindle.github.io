        		<h1>All about me </h1>
							<p>Professionally, I'm a creative person who loves experimenting with new ideas, whether it be content generation, Excel financial charts and graphs, or PowerPoint design.</p>
							<p>Over the course of the last year and a half, I've gained invaluable experience in the private equity world. I've learned about investor relations, pitch book presentations, compliance, and real estate KPIs. Prior to my work in private equity, PwC employed me as an auditor and consultant, where I learned the value of having incredibly talented and collaberative teams and was given opportunities to explore new industries.</p>
							<p>Personally, I am always reading something. I run competitively at least once a year, and I make sure to attend yoga at least once a week, mainly for the meditative aspects. I am very passionate about the community in which I live, and I volunteer with Austin Pets Alive! in my spare time.</p>
